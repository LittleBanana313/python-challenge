# Create a Python script that analyzes the PyBank records to calculate each of the following:
# -The total number of months included in the dataset
# -The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# -The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# -The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
# -Print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results
